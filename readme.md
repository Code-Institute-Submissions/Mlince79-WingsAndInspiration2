# Wings And Inspiration
Data Centric Development Milestone Project- Code Institute

This project is a continuation of the second milestone. 
This time including Build a SQLAlchemy Flask project for a web application that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain. 
The project is an exercise of the 
I got the recomendation from my mentor to do it with MONGO DB but I was very interested to know and appply the SQLAlchemy and I find it very usefull. In the last revision he was ok with it. 
This website will offer all women the opportunity to get in contact with a great companion. Under the umbrella of Wings and Inspiration project, Denisse will provide her Coaching to help them adapt to their new country the best way, and be able to live their Expat life to the fullest.

## UX
This project is still a tailored development for Denisse, who recently became a coach. She started her website on WordPress but struggled and did not get it the way she wanted. She did not have a clear objective of what she wanted to accomplish with her site.

Her original website check [here](https://github.com/Mlince79/WingsAndInspiration/blob/master/uxStrategy/Original%20home.jpg).

While listening to her story and after little research on this second project, we came up with the idea to focus on the women who feel overwhelmed. There are hi statistics where we can see how some groups of women are burning out or experiencing anxiety. 

Denisse has a personal call, and she is passionate about helping women.


### Website design and style :
- Approachable
- Caring
- Natural/Organic

## Features

In terms of the scope, Denisse has a big vision with the website where she will be able to offer online bookings for her customers and allowed them to execute the online payment, among other features.

## Technologies

## Testing
At the bottom of all the sections will be a button with a call to action a clear offer. They can request a free 30 min session leaving just their email and a short message about them. If the user tries to submit the contact form with an invalid email address, there will be an error noting the invalid email address.
In the "About Me" section, they can read a bit about Denisse's background, and her photo. 
In "My Coaching," they will learn more about who this coaching is for and what it is offering.  In this section, the user will be able to answer a question. At the end of the survey, the user will be able to see a graphic on big screens. 
In "Events" will display the map of Stockholm and will show the place and description of the coming events. 

They are also able to view Denisse's social media profiles via clicking on the icons in the footer. All links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"'

It is a responsive website.
This site tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on various mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, 7: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy)
