# Wings And Inspiration
Stream One Project: Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project - Code Institute

This project is a continuation of the first milestone. The idea was to include professional design and include the requirements of Javascript and Javascript API. 
This website will offer all women the opportunity to get in contact with a great companion. Under the umbrella of Wings and Inspiration project, Denisse will provide her Coaching to help them adapt to their new country the best way, and be able to live their Expat life to the fullest.

## UX
This project is still a tailored development for Denisse, who recently became a coach. She started her website on WordPress but struggled and did not get it the way she wanted. She did not have a clear objective of what she wanted to accomplish with her site.

Her original website check [here](https://github.com/Mlince79/WingsAndInspiration/blob/master/uxStrategy/Original%20home.jpg).

While listening to her story and after little research on this second project, we came up with the idea to focus on the women who feel overwhelmed. There are hi statistics where we can see how some groups of women are burning out or experiencing anxiety. 

Denisse has a personal call, and she is passionate about helping women.


### Website design and style :
- Approachable
- Caring
- Natural/Organic
- Helpful

## Features

In terms of the scope, Denisse has a big vision with the website where she will be able to offer online bookings for her customers and allowed them to execute the online payment, among other features.
The whole scope [here](https://github.com/Mlince79/WingsAndInspiration/blob/master/uxStrategy/Scope%20level.jpg)

### Existing Features

The scope level in phase 2 will be:
- Home - where the user can read a callout and book a first 30 min free session.
- About Me - the user will get to know Denisse's biography.
- My Coaching - the user will get to know about Denisse's Coaching (at the moment, the text is not real).
- The blog is a section under construction. 
- Events will display the map of Stockholm and will show the place and description of the coming events. 


### Features Left to Implement

- Blog - in this section, it is planned that every week will post relevant articles for Expat women.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap (3.3.7)
- Javascript

## Testing
As soon as women arrive at the Home and at the bottom of all the sections will be a button with a call to action a clear offer. 
They can request a free 30 min session leaving just their email and a short message about them. If the user tries to submit the contact form with an invalid email address, there will be an error noting the invalid email address.
In the "About Me" section, they can read a bit about Denisse's background, and her photo. 
In "My Coaching," they will learn more about who is this coaching for and what it is offering.  In this section, the user will be able to answer a question. At the end of the survey, the user will be able to see a graphic on big screens. 
In "Events" will display the map of Stockholm and will show the place and description of the coming events. 

They are also able to view Denisse's social media profiles via clicking on the icons in the footer. All links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"'

It is a responsive website.
This site tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, 7: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy)

HTML and CSS code were both validated at the following pages:
- https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri+with_options
- https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

## Deployment

This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.

To run locally, the user can clone this repository directly into the editor of their choice by pasting git clone https://github.com/Mlince79/WingsAndInspiration.git into their terminal.
